I develop engaged research communities that provide a sense of belonging to our members, opportunities to develop new research colloaborations and to develop techincal skills. I advocated for the community's needs to senior leadership. I develop and faciliate activities that enable members to participate in ways that suit them/needs. This includes receiving updates via the website, newsletters or social media, participating in committees or events; or leading initiatives supported through small grant schemes.
