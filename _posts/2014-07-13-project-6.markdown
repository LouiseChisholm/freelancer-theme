I help researchers to identify potential funding sources for their research and to develop strong applications with the best possible chance of success. I coordinate and develop large-scale strategic bids. I write non-techincal propsoal sections and prepare research teams for interviews with grant review panels. Projects that I contributed to include:

* STFC UK SKA Regional Centre (
* Various proposals supporting the development abnd growth of the Materials and Molecular Modelling (MMM) Hub, a Tier 2 national supercomputing centre, which supports the UK-wide MMM community. PI: Prof Scott Woodley, UCL Chemistry. Thomas, Young, PAX.
* Various proposals related to Exascale Computing ALgorithms & Infrastructures Benefiting UK Research (ExCALIBUR): UCL Adaptable Cluster, Software Environment for Actionable & VVUQ-evaluated Exascale Applications (SEAVEA); Learned Exascale Computational Imaging (LEXCI)
* EPSRC Research Software Engineer Fellowship: Dr Tom Dowrick who is improving research translation in image guided surgery. 5 fellowships were funded nationally.
* Health Data Research UK Using medicines data to understand the effects of COVIDâ€“19 on clinical care, Prof Reecha Sofat, UCL Institute of Health Informatics (now University of Liverpool).
